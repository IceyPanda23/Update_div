Subject: THE UPDATE DIV WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE THE QUERY 
 
Dear Joshua,



Heres is the latest version of update div and it works different payment method codes for different dbs but also secludes the EABL db with its unique script of no paymentmethodcode.

In summary you can edit the update.py script with vscode under the comment in the script you'll find the query
