Good Afternoon Team,
Nationwide demonstrations are expected on Monday, 7th July 2025, in observance of Saba Saba Day. Consequently, please note that our offices will be closed, and all staff will be required to work remotely on that day.
Kindly ensure you carry your laptops with you today as you attend the staff dinner. After the dinner, we encourage carpooling where possible for safe travel back home.
Let us all remain vigilant and prioritize safety.
