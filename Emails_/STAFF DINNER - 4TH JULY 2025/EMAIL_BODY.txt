Good Morning Team,

On behalf of the Board and Management, I would like to invite you to a staff dinner to be held on Friday, 4th July 2025, at Fogo Gaucho, Westlands from 7:00 PM. This will be an opportunity for us to unwind after an extremely challenging period and to reflect on the year so far and celebrate our collective efforts and achievements.

Kindly confirm your attendance by Wednesday, 2nd July 2025 to assist with planning and reservations.

Regards,
Jacqueline Rotich.
