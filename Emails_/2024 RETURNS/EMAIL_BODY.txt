Dear all,

I trust you are well and we have all filed 2024 returns ahead of dateline of 30th June 2025.Most of us have gotten emails from KRACare indicating you owe KRA certain amount, kindly login to KRA portal and apply for TCC and if you are unable to get you will be able to see if there is any tax liability. I have also received the same but upon checking on the portal there is no liability.

Kindly note accessing the portal now might be difficult because many last minute Kenyans are trying to file the returns.
